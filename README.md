# RSSL

A shader language that is heavily based on HLSL

The RSSL compiler contains components to preprocess, lex, parse, and type check RSSL source. The only current target is to export out to HLSL.

# Why another shader language?

Writing compilers is fun so why not?

The original intent was to add custom syntax for shader bindings and pipeline state for toy render frameworks. Maybe at some point I'll get around to doing that.
